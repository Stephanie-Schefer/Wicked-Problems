# Search Optimization on Etsy

[]!()

Etsy, a platform crafters use to sell their handmade goods, provides an interesting investigation into how online retailers use search optimization to enhance the user experience. Unlike, other e-commerce sites however, Etsy is a two-sided marketplace, meaning that buyers are searching for interesting and unique goods while sellers are using the platform Etsy provides to reach more buyers. Due to the optimized results being a manipulated version of an organic search, there are some ethical considerations as to which party is being hurt, either the buyer or the seller, when search results are changed.

Etsy’s data scientists cannot go around asking each individual customer questions about their personal likes and dislikes.  As Diane Hu said, “What companies do have are piles and piles of data concerning how users navigate their site and/or consume their content” (Cameron). In fact, almost every click from a user is recorded. This data is referred to as low-level data, because a click simply means nothing by itself. However, when each click is recorded and tracked between thousands of customers, then patterns are discovered. The conclusions drawn from low-level data aim to uncover the high-level knowledge about the customers such as their thoughts about why they came to the Etsy site, what style product do they like, if they buy product X, do they also want product Y that is related, etc. Knowing the answers to these questions by observing data is a powerful tool to create a more personalized search experience in a remote setting. 

The high-level knowledge obtained from recording clicks is an important factor in the algorithm. One metric Etsy uses as an algorithm input is a listing quality score. Every time a customer clicks on, favorites, or purchases an item, it improves the products quality score. Items with higher scores have a potential to appear higher on the search results. According to Etsy, “Search engines like to show results that are relevant and interesting, but gauging "interestingness" is a bit tricky for a computer” (“Shop”). The patterns found through the listing quality, is the voice that talks to the algorithm to say what customers like and they style product they are after. For example, if a customer searches for a “crochet hat” they might want a written pattern versus when they search “winter hat” they might want a finished good. This knowledge is obtained through the patterns found. The quality score is just one piece to the puzzle that all fit together to optimize searches because the Etsy search engine is like a two-way street. The sellers themselves are inputting attributes and keywords, while Etsy takes these descriptions, matches it to the customers search as well as combines it with data from customer actions to create a blend of search results. Students at Cornell university did a study on search optimization for two sided marketplaces and found that a linear composition of various metrics was best. They combined the metrics such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain and Expected Reciprocal Rank into a final Fitness Function. 

Manipulating search results unfortunately has some flaws. If a customer searches for an outdoor pillow, pillows with fabrics not specifically designed for outdoor use can appear if a pattern was discovered from previous customers. This is detrimental for sellers as well, because if customers mistakenly purchase a product that does not accurately fit their needs, it reflects poorly on the seller’s business. Despite mistakes happening, optimization models aim to help however. The machine learning can save time for buyers, and time has a great value associated with it. Data scientists are always searching for ways of improving the algorithm the learn more about their customers in order to help.
