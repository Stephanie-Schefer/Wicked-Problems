# Data Science Leads Sustainability Efforts For Businesses

![]()

Consumers like to know their money is going to well-rounded businesses whose values align with their own personal views. Because of this, competition in the modern workplace has led to a greater rise in companies demonstrating their ethical practices to customers in order to win over their business, as businesses have a corporate social responsibility to uphold. In terms of data science, there is now a need for sustainability analytics to be able to quantify the benefits of these business practices to stockholders and consumers as well as to internal members of the business to show the financial impacts of the companies’ social responsibility. 

For UPS, corporate social responsibility means demonstrating that they use optimal routes to reduce miles driven by their workers. In turn, UPS saves on fuel costs and wages, but they also reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, which appeals to many consumers. Before technology and data analytics were being used in the shipping industry, delivery drivers were told to avoid as many left hand turns as possible because left turns meant idling in the road, increasing the gas consumption. Now with technology, UPS uses a dynamic routing system called ORION (the on-road integrated optimization and navigation) to optimize routes beyond what an individual driver is capable of creating on their own. With this machine learning UPS can benefit customers by providing them with more up to date information about their packages, as well as a better estimate for arrival time. The algorithm did not appear overnight, but rather has taken over a decade to develop the machine learning due to the complexities associated with UPS being such a large company. “Arguably the world’s largest operations research project, ORION uses expansive fleet telematics and advanced algorithms to gather and calculate countless amounts of data…”(“ORION Backgrounder”) ORION has on average been able to save each driver one mile each day. This may not seem like a lot, but this small amount saves UPS 50 million dollars annually, 100 million miles per day, 10 million gallons of fuel, and 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. 

To save time and distance traveled for each driver’s unique route, ORION does not just create one route per area because the specific combination of deliveries each day as well as unforeseen road closures. Instead, ORION uses an algorithm that spans 1,000 pages of code to develop dynamic routing depending on the specific circumstances for the day. This code takes into account delivery locations, the turns made: right vs. left, distance traveled, fuel amount, total time, and many other factors to create an optimized route. The output route is not set in stone at this point because ORION continually monitors road conditions and updates accordingly onto the driver’s map. The ORION route is not necessarily a perfect route, but one that solves complex routing problems based on the data it gathers, showing an optimal order of deliveries taking multiple factors into consideration. The best route is not always the shortest one if the driver’s waste time at lights or fuel trying to turn left. These problems are some of the many that have been thought about and placed into the code. ORION has become more successful developing routes as time has gone on because it has been able to find trends in the data and output more accurate results. “It learns over time and speeds up the process” (“ORION: The”). Looking into the future, UPS hopes to apply the same machine learning with electric delivery trucks. Instead of saving fuel, they would be increasing the miles traveled on one charge of battery by driving a more efficient route for electric power or simply driving fewer miles to get the job done. Again the efficiency will be a quantifiable number to provide consumers and investors.
