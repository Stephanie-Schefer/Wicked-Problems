Consumers like to know their money is going to well-rounded business whose values align with their own personal views. Because of this, competition in the modern workplace has led to a greater rise in companies demonstrating their ethical practices to customers in order to win over their business, as businesses have a “corporate social responsibility” to uphold. In terms of data science, there is now a need for sustainability analytics to be able to quantify the benefits of these business practices to stockholders and consumers as well as to internal members of the business to show the financial impacts of the companies social responsibility. 

For UPS, corporate social responsibility means demonstrating that they use optimal routes to reduce miles driven by their workers. In turn, UPS saves on fuel costs and wages, but they also reduce their carbon dioxide emissions, an appeal for many consumers. Before technology and data analytics were being used in the shipping industry, delivery drivers were told to avoid as many left hand turns as possible because left turns meant idling in the road, increasing the gas consumption. Now with technology, UPS uses a dynamic routing system called ORION, or the on-road integrated optimization and navigation, to optimize routes beyond what an individual driver is capable of creating on their own. With this machine learning, UPS can benefit customers by providing them with more up to date information about their packages, as well as a better estimate for arrival time. The algorithm ORION uses did now appear overnight, but has rather taken over a decade to develop the machine learning due to the complexities associated with UPS being such a large company. Many have argued that ORION is the world’s largest “operations research project.” ORION has on average been able to save each driver one mile each day. This may not seem like a lot, but this small amount saves UPS 50 million dollars annually, 100 million miles per day, 10 million gallons of fuel, and 100,000 metric tons of Carbon Dioxide emissions. 

To save time and distance traveled for each driver’s unique route, ORION does not just create one route per area because the specific combination of deliveries each day as well as periodic road closures. Instead, ORION uses an algorithm that spans 1,000 pages of code to develop routes depending on the specific circumstances for the day. This code takes into account delivery locations, the turns made: right vs. left, distance traveled, fuel amount, total time, and many other factors to create an optimized route. The ORION route is not necessarily a perfect route, but one that solves complex routing problems based on the data it gathers, showing an optimal order of deliveries taking multiple factors into consideration. The best route is not always the shortest one if the driver’s waist time at lights or fuel trying to turn left. These problems are some of the many that have been thought about and placed into the code. ORION has become more successful developing routes as time has gone on because it has been able to find trends in the data and output more accurate results.
