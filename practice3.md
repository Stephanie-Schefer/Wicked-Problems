# A Person's Path Between Homes

![](path.png)


## Explanation Of Graph

This plot shows a path of a salesman going between 7 homes in a neighboorhood. These homes were randomly selected from all 50 homes located in the area. The landscape of the area is represented by the circles in the graph. There are 40 small trees and 12 large trees located throughout. 


### How to Create
This challenge question manipulated the previous graph made. It still used a similar outline and commands, but the number dwellings, trees, homes selected and possible x and y values were larger. To make the number labels above the dwelling instead of overtop, I added a +50 to the north locs label. This was one of the things I learned from creating this plot as well as that I have to be very careful with what commands are turned on and off from previous graphs.
