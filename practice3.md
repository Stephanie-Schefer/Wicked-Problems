## How to Create
This challenge question manipulated the previous graph made. It still used a similar outline and commands, but the number dwellings, trees, homes selected and possible x and y values were larger. To make the number labels above the dwelling instead of overtop, I added a +50 to the north locs label. This was one of the things I learned from creating this plot as well as that I have to be very careful with what commands are turned on and off from previous graphs.
