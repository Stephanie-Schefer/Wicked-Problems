# The Potential For Data Science

As Geoff West notes, “measurement has played a central role in the development of our understanding of the entire universe around us.” When data can be quantified, or measured, then data scientists can start to break it apart, find trends, and thus conclusive models can be made to analyze human behavior. As data science advances, more data can be collected, stored, and incorporated into the models to make better predictions about the issue at hand, yet the implications of the conclusions that are drawn has a potential for both positive as well as negative consequences.

From project 5, we used data about the nighttime lights in our country as a predictor for the population density. This application of data science allows us to draw conclusions about whether an area is urban or rural based on the amount of light present. As data science improves, there are more detailed spacial images allowing for the conclusions to be more precise in terms of the geographic location as opposed to a broader landmass. This application is positive and can be applied to other research in the future.

Having a more detailed consensus about common beliefs within an area unfortunately can polarize society as an unintended byproduct. Now that data on beliefs can be collected through individual’s interactions on the internet, generalizations about opinions based on geographic location is now possible. When typing in a Google search of a keyword such as “climate change”, depending on your geographic location, Google’s autocomplete will vary from “climate change is a hoax” to “climate change is accelerating.” The autocomplete is based on algorithms that have been able to predict opinions based on past data from that area. While it is amazing what the algorithm can do, there are concerns associated with it. What if the individual just types in “climate change?” Are the articles that appear as most relevant to the search skewed to present only the opinion of the majority based on their current location? If an individual types in a biased search then they should get a biased set of results based on the algorithm pulling articles relevant to their search, but if they type in a neutral search, then the articles that appear should be neutral as well, and not based on the predictions made based on geographic location. The harm in this is contributing to the polarization of society as people are being “steered” towards certain beliefs.

Much of the improvement in the ability to describe, analyze, and predict how humans think and behave from using data science stems from the large grasp social media has in today’s society. To understand how people behave, social media platforms look at users past interactions and how they respond to notifications about a certain subject matter or updates about another user. This is all done so the platform can reach their goal of getting individuals to spend more time on their site. As the user has more engagement, the predictive power of the machine-learning techniques becomes greater as the AI “gets to know” the individual. Now that the predictive power of algorithms is more accurate, in addition to getting individuals to spend more time on social media, proprietary algorithms are able to show the most relevant results because they “know” what you want to see. But the downside to this is that now there are echo chambers where users are under the false assumption that everyone thinks the same way they do because they never see any contrary information. The improvements in data science makes it possible to use proprietary algorithms but it is taking away human choices and making society vulnerable to confirmation bias.

The world of data science is not just black and white, there are a lot of gray areas with regards to ethical behavior. It all boils down to the intentions as well as consequences of how data science is being used. There is plenty of room for data science in our society. It is a quickly growing and a relatively new field. Realigning this science onto a path that will benefit society rather than harm it is essential for this generation of data scientists, before the damage becomes irreversible.
