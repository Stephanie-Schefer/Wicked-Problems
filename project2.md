# Project 2: Data Management Fundamentals
## Data is from the American Community Survey 5-Year Data from the years 2010 to 2014

The following graphs show state populaitons collected from survey data from 2010 to 2014. The first plot shows the actual state population for each year. The second plot shows the average population change, so each state has a constant slope over the 4 year span. Both plots are broken down into 9 quantiles based on the size of the population change that occured in the first plot, and the size of the average population change in the second plot.
