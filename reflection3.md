#Data Science Applications for Hiring

Companies are in a constant state of competition, and are always seeking to get ahead of their competitors by using data more effectively to benefit their business including during the recruitment process. Using technology to optimize the recruitment process is not simply about getting information about the hiring company out to more candidates, as this does not guarantee that the company would end up with a good hire. Instead, using data science for recruitment is focused on improving the “candidate experience,” so they feel valued through the process. Part of this is taking action and making decisions based on data analytics rather than a recruiter’s own personal bias or a hunch as to which is the right candidate. There is thus a demand for “talent analytics” and “people science” so hiring agencies can quantify traits about an individual to see if they would be a great candidate for the job.

Some of the data that is generally used within the field of recruitment data science includes “candidate profiles, company information, job specs, interview decisions, hiring decisions and salary information.” This data is unfortunately difficult to analyze as the candidate’s profile includes submissions of resumes and cover letters, which all vary in format and language. Turning the data into a usable format is a daunting task, but one that helps automate the hiring process so it can move forward in a timely manner. In 2012, “deep learning models” began to emerge to help with this issue. This learning network uses “artificial neurons” which span multiple layers, each layer becoming more complex and abstract in nature. This can help with translating between languages. The neural machine translation looks at whole sentences and not just individual words, so it does not require as much memory as a statistical model would. Now recruitment companies can have access to more data and are able to do many things with the data including finding people whose skills could be transferred easily into meeting the current need of a company. The data also helps with identifying groups of candidates and comparing them, finding trends with regards to hiring, and even the development of “automated recruitment platforms” to help people make networking connections.

One such platform is Linked In, a third-party group that helps individuals find job openings as well as helping their own customers get the most qualified hires. Linked In is doing research in “computational advertising (online advertising), data and graph mining, machine learning and infrastructure, recommender systems, A/B testing and much more” in order to improve their process of matching workers to hiring companies. For Linked In, the top 3 signals used in their algorithm to match individuals with jobs are personal connections, interest relevance, and engagement probability. Personal connections are given more weight and are found through people they interact directly with online, coworkers of present and past jobs, and information such as interests and skills found on their profile. Relevancy is found through the language of the post and the topics discussed. Engagement probability is found using “multi-objective optimization” which occurs when LinkedIn predicts if you will like or comment on a post based on who you have interacted with in the past and the frequency this has occurred. In general, Linked In best serves individuals who are active on their profile so that the algorithm starts to “know” them. While the nature of hiring using data science and technology improves the experience for those looking for a job, it ultimately benefits the hiring agency as well because they are able to attract the most qualified workers, allowing them to produce better services for their clients, the company hiring, who are then given a leg up against their competitors.
