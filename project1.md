# Project 1 : Data Management Basics

## Data is from the National Center For Educational Statistics for the year 2015.

The following two plots graphically represent the total number of applications received by institutions across the United States, within distinct graphical regions. The regional bars are color coded by state, so one can see the proportional distribution within each region as to which state(s) the applications came from. By comparing the two plots, one can compare the total number of applications within each region, or more specifically within each state, received by institutions offering a minimum of a 4 year degree versus a mimimum of a doctoral degree.
