# Introduction

Hello! I'm Stephanie and I am from Warrenton, Virginia. My academic interests include business and entrepreneurship, but I took this COLL 100 class to explore data science. I am a total beginner with data science so I am hoping this class will push me to learn a lot! Outside of academics, I love baking, photography, and crocheting. I have started my own small business called SA Originals where I sell handmade crochet items which I plan to continue through college and beyond.
